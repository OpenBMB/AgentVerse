[33m[Bella]: Alright, let's break down the task. First, we need to understand the rules of Sudoku. Second, we need to devise a solution for the game. And finally, we need to write a python script that can solve Sudoku automatically. I propose the following sub-tasks:
1. Use the `bing_search` tool to find the rules of Sudoku.
2. Discuss and formulate a general strategy to solve Sudoku based on the rules.
3. Write a Python script to implement the strategy and solve Sudoku puzzles.
Given our backgrounds, I suggest that I take on the third sub-task of writing the Python script, as I have a strong background in Python programming and algorithm development. Charlie, could you take on the first task of using `bing_search` to find the rules of Sudoku? Once we have the rules, we can both work on devising a solution strategy. Does this sound alright? [0m

Observation: "Advanced Sudoku strategies are used in the hardest levels of these puzzles and they can either help to reduce candidates or to find the solution for a specific cell. Regardless, their application always demands high levels of concentration from the player as they work by deduction.\nThe X-Wing method is one of the most basic advanced Sudoku strategies. It can also be applied in some intermediate levels, although its incidence is very low in these cases. Its goal is to eliminate candidates.\nThe player can use this strategy when there is one candidate repeated in four cells that form a square or rectangle when mentally connected by row and column. By making an X linking diagonally the two opposite extremities of this rectangle, the player finds only two possible sets of positions for that digit.\nThe next step will be to test those sets on the grid and eliminate the digit from any cell that would become impossible in both situations.\nExample\nIn this example, the number 5 forms the necessary pattern to apply the X-Wing strategy. By connecting the cells containing it, it is easy to see that in this situation only the pairs in green or yellow could be possible. Testing the pairs on the grid shows that the 5 highlighted in red would be impossible in both cases. It can then be eliminated as a candidate to that cell.\nThis strategy helps to eliminate a candidate from cells too. To apply it, the player must find a digit candidate to two cells in the same row, in three different rows. These cells must also be united by column, regardless of the shape they create.\nConnecting them will result in a closed chain that reveals two sets of possible placements for that digit. The player can then put them to the test and eliminate that number as a candidate to the cells where it would become impossible in both cases.\nExample\nIn this grid, number 4 is a candidate to two cells in three different rows, allowing the player to use the Swordfish technique.\nConnecting them reveals that whenever a digit highlighted in green is possible, the yellows become impossible and vice-versa. Thus, there are only two sets of possibilities within this chain for number 4, the green and the yellow sets.\nWhen testing them on the grid, the player finds that the 4 highlighted in red would be an impossible candidate in both cases. It can then be safely removed from that cell, leaving only numbers 1 and 2 as candidates to it.\nForcing chains is one of the easiest advanced Sudoku strategies to understand. Unfortunately, applying it requires very high levels of concentration and the outcome can be uncertain. When it does work, it gives the player the solution for one cell.\nTo apply a simple forcing chain, there must be cells with only two candidates in the grid. The player picks one and begins testing the changes to puzzle when applying each of the two digits in that cell. The goal is to find if there is a cell that would bear the same result whichever digit is used. If so, that will safely be the solution for it.\nExample\nIn this example, the top highlighted cell with the candidates 1 and 2 was used to apply the forcing chains technique. When testing for both digits, the player finds that the outcome for the highlighted cell with candidates 5 and 7 is always 5. Therefore, this digit will be the solution for that particular cell.\nNote that when testing for number 1, the player could also have made a chain by going right (to the cell with 1 and 4 as candidates). The chain would be longer, but the result is the same. 5 is still the answer to the highlighted cell.\nOut of the advanced Sudoku strategies, the forcing chains method is usually a last resort as the chains can be very long and complicated and they do not always produce results.\nThe XY-Wing is a strategy to remove candidates. It can be applied when there are three cells in the grid, each with only a pair of candidates that share at least one digit among them (e.g. AB/AC/CB). With a bit of mental effort, the player can picture a Y when connecting them, with one cell working as the stem and the remaining as the branches.\nThe next step is to trace lines in each row and column of the cells to form a square or rectangle. If any of the shared digits are candidates within the lines connecting the cells or at an intersection point, they can be safely removed.\nExample\nIn the example above, the stem cell contains the digits 2 and 9 (highlighted in orange) and connects to the branches, each with one of these digits as candidates (purple squares).\nIf any of the cells on the red paths contained one candidate shared by the cells on the extremities of the lines, it could be eliminated, but this is not the case.\nHowever, the cell at the intersection of both branches of the Y contains a shared digit by both (number 1), allowing the player to eliminate it as a candidate to that cell.\nAny Sudoku puzzle must have only one possible solution. However, at the most extreme levels, the players might find themselves with two. This happens when there is a “deadly pattern”. This pattern happens when there 4 cells with the same pair of candidates facing each other. For it to be “deadly” each set of two cells must also be placed within the same group.\nTo avoid having multiple solutions, the player must apply the strategy of the unique rectangle. During the game, and when facing the prospect of a deadly pattern, the player must check if one of those four cells has any other candidates to them. If so, he or she can eliminate the problematic digits from it and leave the remaining candidates.\nExample\nIn this table, the player faces a possible deadly pattern with the candidates 2 and 3, in which the placement of those digits can become indifferent in the end and result in two possible solutions for the puzzle. Since one of the cells also contains 8 as a candidate, the player can use the unique rectangle method to eliminate the pair 2 and 3 from it and avoid the deadly pattern in the end.\nIn theory, the unique square technique should be the least used out of the advanced Sudoku strategies, even in the hardest levels, as this pattern only occurs when the puzzle is poorly designed albeit not wrong.\nThe Nishio strategy takes its name from professional puzzle player Tetsuya Nishio who is credited with inventing it. Out of all the advanced Sudoku strategies, this is the one that players avoid the most and use only as a last resource as it takes guessing as a premise.\nBasically, the player must take a cell with two candidates, choose one, and try to solve the grid. If it works, great. If not, the player must return to the starting point and choose the other. The point of this strategy is that as soon as an incompatibility arises, the starting candidate can be eliminated which turns the remaining into the solution for that cell.\nHowever, a simple miscalculation due to lack of concentration can turn the puzzle unsolvable and/or the incompatibility might not arise until the very end of the puzzle, which is why players tend to avoid this technique.\nThe theoretical approach of advanced Sudoku strategies is relatively easy to understand and to apply. The biggest difficulty is to find the right patterns on the grid and to know which technique to use in each case.\nNevertheless, only experts reach the levels in which they are required and at that point knowing and being familiar with these strategies becomes a requirement to progress in the hardest levels of these puzzles."

Observation: "How to Play Sudoku?\n- Sudoku Rule № 1: Use Numbers 1-9\nSudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated? As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.\n- Sudoku Rule № 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers\nAs you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.\nFor example, in the upper left square, we know we need to add a 5 and a 6 to be able to complete the square, but based on the neighboring rows and squares we cannot clearly deduce which number to add in which space. This means that we should ignore the upper left square for now, and try to fill in spaces in some other areas of the grid instead.\n- Sudoku Rule № 3: Don’t Guess\nSudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.\n- Sudoku Rule № 4: Use Process of Elimination\nWhat do we mean by using “process of elimination” to play Sudoku? Here is an example. In this Sudoku grid (shown below), the far left-hand vertical column (circled in Blue) is missing only a few numbers: 1, 5 and 6.\nOne way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking to see which other numbers are already included within each square – since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).\nIn this case, we can quickly notice that there are already number 1s in the top left and center left squares of the grid (with number 1s circled in red). This means that there is only one space remaining in the far left column where a 1 could possibly go – circled in green. This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku – you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing – and then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.\nSudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated – but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it’s all based on the simple principles of using numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each square, row or column."

The process of elimination is a key strategy in solving Sudoku puzzles. Bella has also successfully written a Python script that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The script checks if a number is valid in a certain cell according to the Sudoku rules and continues this process until the puzzle is solved. [0m
